# One-off Codes

This is a collection of shell scripts, and python scripts that I write to achieve a discrete task

## Getting Started

All scripts are written for ZSH and/or Python 3.

### Installing
All scripts should be able to run in isolation.
eg.
```
chmod +x script.py
./scripts.p
```

## Contributing

I am more than happy to be shown how to improve these scripts. Simply fork, edit, and submit a PR with any changes.
