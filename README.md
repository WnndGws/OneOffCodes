# Scripts

This is a collection of shell scripts, and Python scripts that I write to achieve a discrete task.

## Getting Started

All shell scripts aim to be POSIX compliant, but are written in ZSH and will thus work best in this environment.  
All Python scripts are written for Python 3.6+.

## Installing

All scripts should be able to run in isolation.  
e.g.

```bash
chmod +x script.py
./scripts.py
```

## Contributing

I am more than happy to be shown how to improve these scripts. Simply fork, edit, and submit a PR with any changes.
